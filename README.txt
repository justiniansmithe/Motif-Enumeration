# Motif-Enumeration

`k` represents the length of the motif you are specifying
for example, if k=4 it will check for motifs that have 4 bases like 'ATCG'

`d` represents how 'off' a motif can be while still being accepted as such
for instance, if d=1,'ATCG' is a motif of 'ATCT' because it is off by 1 'd'.



On line 20: alter the first argument if you want to use your dataset but make sure it has the proper format.

For example: 
k, d
